Troubleshooting
===============


Formatting still fails after running ``project:fix``
----------------------------------------------------

If when you execute:

#. Run ``project:fix``
#. Run ``project:format``

you receive an error from ``project:format`` (i.e. ``isort`` or ``black``), it it
likely that you need to update your configuration to align with :ref:formatting_code.

The automatic formatting is doing x, but we shouldn't do that because of y
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usually, automatic formatting is helpful, but there are rare cases where a develop might
in specific areas to ignore automatically applied formatting.

.. note::
 To ensure that automatic formatting remains useful, developers should always seek
 to use the minimum fix reasonable for the affected code. In most cases, this would
 mean adding a comment for a single line.

In the ``checks.yml``, ``project:format`` wants me to reformat code I did not modify
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is likely due to one of our tools (i.e. `black`) being upgraded. Within the
`pyproject.toml` of the PTB, dependencies are specified to allow
compatible versions or a restricted version range (i.e., `^6.0.1`, `>=24.1.0,<26.0.0`).
Such specifications should restrict major reformatting changes to coincide only with a
new major version of the PTB. However, sometimes a tool's versioning may not properly
adhere to semantic versioning.

If you encounter this scenario, please:

#. Ensure that your `pyproject.toml` has the PTB restricted to compatible versions
   (i.e., `^1.7.0`).
#. Identify which tool is trying to reformat files that you did not modify.
#. Reset your `poetry.lock` to align with your **default branch**.
#. More selectively update your `poetry.lock` with `poetry update <package-name>`.
#. Share with your team which tool & version led to the unexpected changes. So that other
   PTB users do not experience the same difficulties, we will update the PTB with a patch
   version to avoid this tool's version and later do a major release to better indicate the
   breaking changes. You could later create an issue in your GitHub repository to update to
   the new major version of the PTB & do the reformatting.
