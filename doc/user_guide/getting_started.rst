.. _Getting Started:

Getting Started
===============

Your usage of the `exasol-toolbox` will likely fall into one of two scenarios:

#. Integration into an existing project.

    If this is your situation, proceed to the section titled :ref:`Integrating Exasol-Toolbox into your Project <existing>`.

#. Creation of a new project.

    If you are starting a new project, please read the section :ref:`Create a New Project with Exasol-Toolbox Support <new project>`.

.. _new project:

Create a New Project with Exasol-Toolbox Support
-------------------------------------------------

.. important::

    To establish a new project with toolbox support, you need to have `Cookiecutter <https://www.cookiecutter.io>`_ installed.

    **TL;DR:**
        :code:`pipx install cookiecutter`


**1. Create a new project**

Cookiecutter will create the project within the current directory. So if you
usually checkout all your GitHub repos in ``~/git`` you could use ``cd ~/git``
before calling cookiecutter.

Use the following command to create a new project:

.. code-block:: shell

   cookiecutter https://github.com/exasol/python-toolbox.git \
     --directory project-template

**2. Follow the interactive project setup prompt**

**3. Bootstrap the development environment**

Navigate to the directory of the newly created project:

.. code-block:: shell

    cd <your-project-name>

Generate a poetry environment for the project:

.. code-block:: shell

    poetry shell

Install all necessary project and development dependencies for the project:

.. code-block:: shell

    poetry install

**4. Start using your project**

List all available nox tasks:

.. code-block:: shell

    nox -l

Integrating Exasol-Toolbox into your Project
--------------------------------------------

1. Add the toolbox as dependency
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. code-block:: shell

    poetry add --group dev exasol-toolbox

2. Provide a project configuration
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Make sure you provide the required configuration. Configuration for the exasol-toolbox gets provided by creating
a ``noxconfig.py`` file in the workspace root. This file should contain at least
a single module constant with the name **PROJECT_CONFIG** pointing to an object,
which is required to to provide the following attributes:

* .. py:attribute:: root
    :type: Path

* .. py:attribute:: doc
    :type: Path

* .. py:attribute:: version_file
    :type: Path

Alternatively you can use the *noxconfig.py* file bellow and adjust the value of the attributes if needed:

.. note::

   Be aware that the plugin definitions are completely optional. For further details on plugins, see the customization section.

.. literalinclude:: ../../noxconfig.py
   :language: python3

3. Configure the tooling
++++++++++++++++++++++++
In order to make all standard task work properly, you need add the configuration settings below to your ``pyproject.toml``,
and adjust the following settings to your project needs:

* coverage
    - source
    - fail_under
* pylint
    - fail-under
* mypy (overrides)
    - module

.. literalinclude:: ../../pyproject.toml
    :language: toml
    :start-after: # Tooling

4. Make the toolbox tasks available
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
In order to use the standard toolbox task via nox, just import them in your ``noxfile.py``.
If you only need the standard tasks provided by the toolbox, your ``noxfile.py`` is straight
forward, and you just can use the example ``noxfile.py`` below.

.. literalinclude:: ../../noxfile.py
   :language: python3
   :end-before: # entry point for debugging


.. attention::

    Keep in mind that the current path may not be included in the :code:`PYTHONPATH`, depending on the operating system you are using. This is explained in more detail in this resource: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/PythonSafePath. Thus, it might be necessary to properly set the :code:`PYTHONPATH` before running nox. This is because our nox tasks expect the `noxconfig` module to be located within the python path.

    For additional information on resolving this issue, please :ref:`refer to <faq_no_module_noxconfig>`.



5. Set up the pre-commit hooks [optional]
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

#. Add a :code:`.pre-commit-config.yaml` file to your project root

    If you want to reuse Nox tasks in the pre-commit hooks, feel free to get some inspiration from the Python toolbox itself:

    .. literalinclude:: ../../.pre-commit-config.yaml
       :language: yaml

#. Enable pre-commit hooks for your workspace

    .. code-block:: shell

        poetry run -- pre-commit install --hook-type pre-commit --hook-type pre-push

.. _toolbox tasks:

6. Set up deploying documentation (optional)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

See :ref:`documentation_configuration` for the required steps.

7. Set up for Sonar
+++++++++++++++++++
PTB supports using SonarQube Cloud to analyze, visualize, & track linting, security, &
coverage. All of our Python projects are evaluated against the
`Exasol Way <https://sonarcloud.io/organizations/exasol/quality_gates/show/AXxvLH-3BdtLlpiYmZhh>`__
and subscribe to the
`Clean as You Code <https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-server/9.8/user-guide/clean-as-you-code/>`__
methodology, which means that SonarQube analysis will fail and, if its included in the branch protections, block a PR
if code modified in that PR does not meet the standards of the Exasol Way.

In order to set up Sonar, you will need to perform the following instructions.

For a **public** project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Specify in the `noxconfig.py` the relative path to the project's source code in `Config.source`
    .. code-block:: python

        source: Path = Path("exasol/<project-source-folder>")
2. Add the 'SONAR_TOKEN' to the 'Organization secrets' in GitHub (this requires a person being a GitHub organization owner)
3. Activate the `SonarQubeCloud App <https://github.com/apps/sonarqubecloud>`_
4. Create a project on SonarCloud
5. Add the following information to the project's file `pyproject.toml`
    .. code-block:: toml

        [tool.sonar]
        projectKey = "com.exasol:<project-key>"
        hostUrl = "https://sonarcloud.io"
        organization = "exasol"
        exclusions = "<source-directory>/version.py,<source_directory>/<directory-to-ignore>/*"
6. Post-merge, update the branch protections to include SonarQube analysis

  * This should only be done when tests exist for the project, & that the project is
    at a state in which enforced code coverage would not be a burden. For new projects,
    we recommend creating an issue to add the SonarQube analysis to the branch protections
    at a later point. In such scenarios, SonarQube analysis will still report its analysis
    results to the PR, but it will not prevent the PR from being merged.

For a **private** project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Specify in the `noxconfig.py` the relative path to the project's source code in `Config.source`
    .. code-block:: python

        source: Path = Path("exasol/<project-source-folder>")
2. Add the 'PRIVATE_SONAR_TOKEN' to the 'Organization secrets' in GitHub (this requires a person being a GitHub organization owner)
3. Activate the `exasonarqubeprchecks App <https://github.com/apps/exasonarqubeprchecks>`_
4. Create a project on https://sonar.exasol.com
5. Add the following information to the project's file `pyproject.toml`
    .. code-block:: toml

        [tool.sonar]
        projectKey = "com.exasol:<project-key>"
        hostUrl = "https://sonar.exasol.com"
        organization = "exasol"
        exclusions = "<source-directory>/version.py,<source_directory>/<directory-to-ignore>/*"
6. Post-merge, update the branch protections to include SonarQube analysis from exasonarqubeprchecks

  * This should only be done when tests exist for the project, & that the project is
    at a state in which enforced code coverage would not be a burden. For new projects,
    we recommend creating an issue to add the SonarQube analysis to the branch protections
    at a later point. In such scenarios, SonarQube analysis will still report its analysis
    results to the PR, but it will not prevent the PR from being merged.

8. Go ðŸ¥œ
+++++++++++++
You are ready to use the toolbox. With ``nox -l`` you can list all available tasks.

.. code-block:: console

    $ nox -l
    Sessions defined in <PATH_TO_YOUR_PROJECT>/noxfile.py:

    * project:fix -> Runs all automated fixes on the code base
    - project:check -> Runs all available checks on the project
    - project:report -> Collects and generates metrics summary for the workspace
    - test:unit -> Runs all unit tests
    - test:integration -> Runs the all integration tests
    - test:coverage -> Runs all tests (unit + integration) and reports the code coverage
    - lint:code -> Runs the static code analyzer on the project
    - lint:typing -> Runs the type checker on the project
    - lint:security -> Runs the security linter on the project
    - lint:dependencies -> Checks if only valid sources of dependencies are used
    - docs:multiversion -> Builds the multiversion project documentation
    - docs:build -> Builds the project documentation
    - docs:open -> Opens the built project documentation
    - docs:clean -> Removes the documentations build folder
    - release:prepare -> Prepares the project for a new release.

    sessions marked with * are selected, sessions marked with - are skipped.


Enjoy!
