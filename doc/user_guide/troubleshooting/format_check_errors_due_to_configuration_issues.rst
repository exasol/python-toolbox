Format Check Errors Due to Configuration Issues
===============================================

If when you execute:

#. Run ``format:fix``
#. Run ``format:check``

you receive an error from ``format:check`` (i.e. ``isort`` or ``black``), it it
likely that you need to update your configuration to align with
:ref:`formatting_configuration`.
