Idioms
------

The initial list of this idioms have been taken form `Raymond Hettinger`_'s
Talk - "`Transform Code into Beautiful, Idiomatic Python`_" (`Transform Python Slides`_).
The list then been updated and extended, we will do our best to give credit for each idom to the source
where we picked it up from, by annotating it the following way:

    ðŸ’¡ learnt from: <Source>, [Reference]

    or

    ðŸ’¡ learnt from:

    * Source: <Source>
    * Reference: [Reference]

    ---

    <Source>: being an author name, book name, etc.

    [Reference]: Optional, a concrete reference to the idiom or the source where it stems from.

That being said, one should be aware that small patterns and idioms often times get "invented" independently
by multiple sources. It is not always clear who was the original source of a specific pattern or idiom.
Therefore our marker intentionally was named *learnt from* because we want communicate, it is the source
where we picked it up from, rather than the "original" source.
